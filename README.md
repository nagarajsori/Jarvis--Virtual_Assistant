# 🤖 MEGA PROJECT 1: JARVIS – Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is your very own voice-activated virtual assistant — inspired by Iron Man, powered by Python, and enhanced with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo.

This assistant can recognize your voice, speak back to you, open websites, play music, fetch the latest news, and even answer general questions just like Alexa or Google Assistant.
